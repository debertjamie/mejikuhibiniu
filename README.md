# MEJIKUHIBINIU

Mejikuhibiniu is a Sundanese traditional game commonly played by children. "Mejikuhibiniu" itself stands for the colors of a rainbow: Merah (red), Jingga (orange), Kuning (yellow), Hijau (green), Biru (blue), Nila (violet), and Ungu (purple).

## How to Play

1. Bet on one of the colors (red, orange, etc)
2. Type the number of fingers to display
3. Count the fingers with "me", "ji", "ku", "hi", "bi", "ni", "u" counts repeatedly until all fingers are counted

There are a couple variaties of the game, but I'm creating a simpler one.
